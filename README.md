# FREX+ - Rendering Extensions for the Fabric Rendering API

Extensions for the Fabric rendering API.  These may or may not be proposed and accepted for inclusion in the Fabric API.  

Also includes a shaded copy of [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) for use by renderer implementations and rendering mods.

Packaged as a separate mod so that rendering implementations and mods that consume these extensions can
depend on it without directly depending on specific implementation.

More information on using FREX+ is available on the [Renderosity Wiki](https://github.com/grondag/renderosity/wiki).

# Using FREX+

Add the maven repo where my libraries live to your build.gradle

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
    	name = "dblsaiko"
    	url = "https://maven.dblsaiko.net/"
    }
}
```

And add FREX+ to your dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {
	modCompile "grondag:frex:0.7.+"
	include "grondag:frex:0.7.+"
}
```

The ```include``` is not necessary if you are depending on another mod that also includes FREX+.  Currently, [Canvas](https://github.com/grondag/canvas) and [JMX](https://github.com/grondag/json-model-extensions) both include FREX+.

Note that version is subject to change - look at the repo to find latest.
